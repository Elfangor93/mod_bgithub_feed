mod_BGitHub Feed
==================

BGitHub Feed is a module for the popular Joomla! Content Management System. It's primary function is to retrieve a list of commits from a given repository and embed them into a Joomla based site. 
However, it supports a number of other functions including

- Listing all repo's owned by a specific user (Repo's can be excluded by name)
- Listing all Issues against a specific repo
- Displaying a basic user profile

The module includes a number of built in styles, ranging from a basic light or dark template to a chromed implementation.


A basic demo of the module can be seen at http://demo.bentasker.co.uk/bgithub-feed/default-settings
